-   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

-   as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-   meet the following conditions:
-
-   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

-
-   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

-   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

-   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

-   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

-   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
